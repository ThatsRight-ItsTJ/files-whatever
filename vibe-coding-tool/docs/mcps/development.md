# MCP Development

For creating custom MCPs, see the dedicated guide in [Developer - MCP Development](../developer/mcp-development.md). This includes using the HF template, implementing tools, job signing, and integration with the orchestrator.

Key points:
- Use FastAPI with mcp-python-sdk for protocol compliance.
- Define tools in mcp.json with input schemas.
- Deploy to HF Spaces for heavy compute.
- Add to registry for routing.

Examples: See [Built-in MCPs](builtin-mcps.md), [Custom MCPs](custom-mcps.md), [Community MCPs](community-mcps.md).

For configuration: [Configuration](configuration.md).
