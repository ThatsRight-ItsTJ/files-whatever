# 🚀 Vibe Coding Tool — Adjusted Development Guide

**Source:** Original plan uploaded as `Vibe coding tool development guide.md` (used as the baseline). fileciteturn0file0

This document updates the original development plan by replacing many proposed custom MCP servers with off‑the‑shelf or community MCP servers where appropriate, and by recommending where small adapter wrappers are a better approach than full custom servers. It also adds concrete next steps and deployment notes.

---

## 📋 Executive summary

- Many of the *custom MCPs* in the original plan can be replaced with off‑the‑shelf MCP servers (or community reference implementations) with **high confidence**. This reduces implementation cost and maintenance burden.
- Some capabilities still require small, focused adapters / wrappers (e.g., cross‑ORM seeding orchestration, Libraries.io breadth). Keep those as lightweight custom MCPs rather than large monoliths.
- The knowledge‑graph first architecture, user‑owned HF + GitHub accounts, and MetaMCP orchestration remain sound — but several operational assumptions in the original plan are optimistic and need adjusting (see evaluation notes at the end).

---

## 🏗️ Updated architecture overview (high level)

Most of the earlier infrastructure choices remain appropriate. The major change: where the original plan listed numerous *custom* MCPs, this guide now recommends specific off‑the‑shelf MCP projects or well‑scoped wrappers.

### Infrastructure (unchanged)
- MetaMCP Orchestrator: Oracle Cloud or another low‑cost host (validate free‑tier limits).
- Frontend: Vercel (Next.js / React).
- Heavy processing: User HuggingFace Spaces (user‑owned). Validate HF quotas and startup times.
- Code & backup storage: User GitHub accounts.
- KG storage: User HuggingFace Datasets or user‑owned vector DB (Qdrant, Pinecone — optional).

## 🔁 Replacing custom MCPs with off‑the‑shelf / community MCP servers

**Approach:** For each custom MCP listed in the original plan, below is a suggested off‑the‑shelf replacement (or recommended wrapper) and a confidence rating (High / Partial / Low). Links are included to the prominent community/official implementations if available.

### AutoBot / Core tooling

| Original custom | Off‑the‑shelf candidate(s) | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Package ecosystem search — `librariesio-mcp-server` | **Keep as specialized custom** OR integrate via third‑party APIs (Libraries.io) as a focused adapter; consider `libraries‑io‑mcp‑server` maintained as small wrapper. | High (keep) | Libraries.io covers many ecosystems; no single off‑the‑shelf MCP matches its breadth. Keep as a lightweight custom MCP that proxies Libraries.io. fileciteturn0file0 |
| File download / repo scaffolding — `GitHub‑File‑Seek‑mcp‑server` | **Implement as wrapper/tool on top of official GitHub MCP** (use GitHub MCP's file/content endpoints + a small wrapper that implements glob/regex search, batching and download orchestration). | High | GitHub MCP already exposes the necessary APIs; building a small adapter is simpler than a full custom server. (See notes for tradeoffs.) |
| GitHub & repo management | **GitHub official MCP** (use official/community MCP server) | High | Use GitHub MCP for repo actions, commits, PRs. Extend with lightweight wrappers for specialized flows. fileciteturn0file0 |
| Deep code search | **Sourcegraph MCP** (community / self‑hosted) | High | Sourcegraph MCP provides deep code search capabilities across large codebases. |
| AI analysis | Pollinations MCP (off‑the‑shelf) | High | Keep as listed. |
| Contextual enrichment | Context7 MCP or existing enrichment MCPs | Partial | Validate feature parity; may need to augment with KG connectors. |
| Security analysis | **Semgrep MCP (official/community)** | High | Semgrep has community MCP adapters and CLI wrappers. |
| Linting / formatting | **Langtools / Prettier / ESLint MCP wrappers** | High | Off‑the‑shelf tools exist; wrap them with small MCP adapters. |
| Code metrics | **Radon MCP** (Python) / other language-specific metric MCPs | High | Use existing radon wrappers for Python, analogous tools for JS/TS. |
| AST / parsing | **Tree‑sitter MCP** (existing) | High | Good match — tree‑sitter integration available. |

### Vibe‑Coding MetaMCP backend

| Original custom | Off‑the‑shelf candidate(s) | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Knowledge Graph Creation — `kglab‑mcp‑server` | **kglab wrapper** (small custom MCP) OR existing KG/Mem servers (e.g., kglab + HF datasets + vector DB) | Partial | kglab is useful — keep as focused adapter that exposes KG tools, ingestion, exports. Do not build a monolith. |
| HF Account integration | **HuggingFace MCP** (official/community) | High | Use HF MCP + OAuth. Validate exact scopes (see evaluation). |
| gitMCP dynamic integration | **GitHub MCP + URL transform wrapper** | High | Implement URL → mcp.io routing via small routing adapter; do not rely on brittle transformations alone. |
| Multi‑provider AI assistant (YPMv0.3) | **Compose existing providers via a small proxy MCP** (wrap HF, OpenAI, Anthropic etc.) | Partial | Build a small multi‑provider proxy rather than a big custom model server. |

### Testing stack

| Original custom | Off‑the‑shelf candidate(s) | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| pytest‑mcp‑server | **mcp_pytest_service** (community) | High | Use community pytest MCP server. citeturn0file0 |
| jest‑mcp‑server | **mcp‑jest / mcp‑frontend‑testing** (community adapters) | Partial/High | Community adapters exist; if not feature complete write a small wrapper. |
| coverage‑mcp‑server | **Aggregate via wrapper** using existing coverage tools (coverage.py, nyc, JaCoCo) exposed by a coverage aggregator MCP | Partial | Build aggregator that normalizes coverage outputs; glue existing reporters. |
| e2e testing | **Playwright MCP / Cypress MCP** (community) | Partial/High | Playwright MCP servers exist in community listings. |

### Deployment stack

| Original custom | Off‑the‑shelf candidate(s) | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Vercel MCP | **Vercel official MCP templates / community repos** | High | Vercel docs & community repos provide ready templates and one‑click patterns. citeturn0file0 |
| Netlify MCP | **Netlify MCP templates / deploy‑button repos** | High | Netlify has known patterns for deploy buttons and serverless adapters. |
| Cloudflare Pages, Workers | **Cloudflare official MCP Server** (Workers, KV, R2, D1) | High | Off‑the‑shelf Cloudflare MCP implementations exist and cover D1/KV/R2/Workers. citeturn0file0 |
| Railway / Docker / GitHub Pages | **Use community MCPs / provider APIs** | Partial | Provider APIs exist — prefer small wrappers. |

### Database stack

| Original custom | Off‑the‑shelf candidate(s) | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| SQL schema generation & ORM integration | **Prisma MCP (for Node/TS)**, **Django MCP (for Django)**, **SQLAlchemy MCP / executeautomation mcp‑database‑server** for Python | High/Partial | Use Prisma for Node/TS; use Django MCP for Django projects; use executeautomation / db‑mcp servers for multi‑DB admin. Compose these rather than a universal single ORM MCP. |
| Database seeding / fixtures | **Prisma seed + adapter wrappers** (for other ORMs write small seeder MCPs) | Partial | Build small seed adapters that expose a common `seed` tool across ORMs. |
| Supabase integration | **Supabase official APIs / community MCP adapter** | High | Use official patterns and wrappers. |

## ⚙️ Recommended small adapters (do these, not big custom servers)

- **GitHub‑File‑Seek wrapper:** small service that calls the GitHub MCP endpoints, implements glob/regex matching, parallel repo traversal with rate‑limit handling, and optional caching. This can be < 200–400 lines of Python/Node + `mcp.json`.
- **Seeding orchestrator adapter:** exposes a single `seed(project, env)` tool; internally dispatches to `prisma db seed`, `python manage.py loaddata`, `alembic upgrade`, or `sequelize-cli db:seed` depending on detected stack.
- **Coverage aggregator MCP:** runs framework‑specific coverage commands, normalizes results into JSON, and generates an LLM‑friendly summary. Can be a small FastAPI/Node service.
- **KG ingestion adapter (kglab):** keep as a focused adapter that executes KG ingestion, incremental updates, and exports (JSON, TTL). Avoid large, monolithic KG servers.

## 🔒 Authentication & permissions — corrections & practical notes

The original plan lists GitHub scopes and HF scopes. Two important notes:

1. **GitHub scopes:** `repo`, `user:email`, `read:org` are reasonable, but be explicit about least privilege. For some features you only need `public_repo`, `workflow`, or narrower scopes. Ask users for minimal scopes and prompt for explicit consent for elevated actions.

2. **HuggingFace scopes:** HF’s OAuth & token model is evolving. The original plan lists `read-repos`, `write-repos`, `manage-repos` — validate these exact scope names against the current HF docs. Some HF actions (deploying Spaces, writing datasets) may require different tokens/roles. Test the HF flow and document required scopes precisely.

3. **Rate limits & quotas:** All provider APIs (GitHub, Cloudflare, HF, Vercel, Netlify) have rate limits or free‑tier quotas. Your orchestration logic must implement retries, exponential backoff, caching and batching. Don’t assume unlimited calls.

---

## ✅ Updated MetaMCP configuration notes

- **Routing logic** remains a good starting point but must include token scoping, rate‑limit-aware routing, and priorities for expensive operations. Use a lightweight job queue (Redis / RQ) or serverless job runner to handle heavy/long tasks instead of synchronous requests.
- **Oracle free tier** can run MetaMCP but monitor limits (bandwidth, CPU, ephemeral disk). Consider fallbacks (small DO droplet, AWS free tier) as needed.

## ✅ Practical migration / implementation plan (short)

**Phase A — Replace high‑confidence items (Weeks 1–2)**
1. Deploy GitHub official MCP and implement a small GitHub‑File‑Seek wrapper (prototype) — exposes `find_files(repo, pattern)`, `download_files(list)`.
2. Deploy Prisma MCP for Node/TS projects and Django MCP for one Python project; verify migrations & seed flows.
3. Deploy Cloudflare official MCP for Workers/KV/R2/D1 flows and test D1 queries.

**Phase B — Compose & extend (Weeks 3–6)**
1. Build seeding orchestrator adapter that exposes a unified `seed` tool for projects (Prisma, Django, Alembic, Sequelize).
2. Integrate mcp_pytest_service and mcp_jest for test execution; build coverage aggregator.
3. Harden auth scopes and rate‑limit handling in MetaMCP.

**Phase C — Polish (Weeks 7–12)**
1. Performance tuning, caching, job queueing (Redis / serverless jobs).
2. Documentation, onboarding, templates (Vercel/Netlify one‑click templates).
3. UAT and community templates.

## 🔍 Evaluation of the original plan — what's helpful vs inaccurate

**Helpful elements to keep:**
- The KG‑driven approach to reduce hallucinations is a strong design decision.
- User‑owned HF + GitHub accounts preserves privacy and cost distribution.
- The modular separation of lightweight & heavy MCPs (oracle vs user HF) is a good pattern.
- The MetaMCP routing pseudocode is a useful starting point.

**Items that are inaccurate, optimistic, or need correction:**
- **"$0 hosting costs":** Free tiers exist, but they come with quotas and throttling. Expect non‑zero costs for scale. (Oracle / Vercel / HF have limits.)
- **HF OAuth scopes listed** may not match current HF scope names; verify current HF docs. fileciteturn0file0
- **Performance targets** (Response time < 5s for most operations) are optimistic for heavy tasks (KG creation, large repo parsing). Treat them as aspirational; add SLAs per operation class.
- **Memory / concurrency guarantees** (500MB, 10+ concurrent) are plausible for lightweight services but may be insufficient for heavy processing; prefer auto‑scaled user HF spaces or larger worker instances.
- **Assuming single MCP per capability** — in practice, use multiple MCPs for redundancy and compose solutions per language/stack.

## ✅ Next immediate deliverables I can produce for you (pick one)

1. `mcp.json` + install & run commands for: GitHub MCP + File‑Seek wrapper, Prisma MCP, Cloudflare MCP (I will include Docker / npx / Vercel deploy snippets).
2. A small GitHub‑File‑Seek wrapper scaffold (Python FastAPI + MCP tool definitions + `mcp.json`) you can deploy to Vercel or as a user HF Space.
3. A seeding orchestrator scaffold that unifies `prisma db seed`, `manage.py loaddata`, and `alembic` into one `seed()` MCP tool.

Tell me which of the three to produce now and I will generate the code & configs in this reply.
